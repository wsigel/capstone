        <h1>Discover Berlin: A City of History, Culture, and Life</h1>
        <section class="container mt-5">
            <h2>Historical Landmarks & World War II Sites</h2>
            <p>
                Berlin is like a living history book, especially for those fascinated by the 20th century. 
                From the rise and fall of the Nazi regime to the Cold War and the Berlin Wall, the city 
                wears its past with stark honesty. Standing before the <span>Brandenburg Gate</span>, you're reminded 
                of both imperial grandeur and Cold War division. A walk along the <span>Berlin Wall Memorial</span> 
                reveals stories of daring escapes and tragic losses. The <span>Topography of Terror</span>, located on 
                the former Gestapo headquarters, offers a sobering look at the Nazi machinery of oppression. 
                Meanwhile, the <span>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</span> evokes powerful emotion through 
                minimalist design. Every monument in Berlin is not just a photo opportunity — it's a story, 
                a lesson, and a chance to reflect.

            <h2>Museums & Art</h2>
            <P>
                Berlin’s cultural wealth is staggering. Whether you're into ancient civilizations or cutting-edge 
                contemporary art, there’s something here for you. <span>Museum Island</span>, with its five iconic institutions, 
                is a treasure trove — from the monumental <span>Ishtar Gate</span> in the Pergamon Museum to classical antiquities 
                in the Altes Museum. For a deeper understanding of Berlin’s complex past, the <span>Jewish Museum</span> uses 
                architecture and storytelling to brilliant effect. Modern and quirky? Try the <span>Berlinische Galerie</span> or 
                the <span>Urban Nation Museum for Urban Contemporary Art</span>. Berlin’s museums aren't just about artifacts — they 
                offer immersive, thought-provoking experiences that make you see the world differently.

            <h2>Neighborhood Culture & Street Life</h2>
            <p>
                Berlin’s real soul lies in its neighborhoods — each one with its own flavor. In <span>Kreuzberg</span>, Turkish 
                markets buzz, murals stretch across buildings, and the nightlife never really sleeps. <span>Prenzlauer Berg</span> 
                offers a softer, more relaxed vibe with leafy streets, organic cafés, and young families in hip coffee 
                shops. In <span>Mitte</span>, where old meets new, you’ll find designer boutiques rubbing shoulders with historic 
                courtyards and art galleries. And in <span>Friedrichshain</span>, creativity runs wild — from graffiti-covered squats 
                to techno clubs in former industrial buildings. Berliners live outdoors, especially in summer — in parks, 
                on canal banks, or just lounging with a beer on a sunny sidewalk.
            </p>

            <h2>Food & Nightlife</h2>
            <p>
                Berlin's food scene is as global as its population. You can start your day with a buttery croissant at 
                a minimalist café, grab a spicy <span>Döner Kebab</span> from a bustling street stall, and end with a six-course 
                tasting menu in a Michelin-starred restaurant — all in one day. Local staples like <span>Currywurst</span>, 
                <span>Berliner Weisse</span> beer, and hearty street food reflect the city’s working-class roots. Markets like 
                <span>Markthalle Neun</span> showcase everything from vegan treats to craft sausages. When the sun sets, Berlin 
                transforms again. Whether you’re sipping cocktails in a speakeasy, dancing in an abandoned warehouse, 
                or watching the sunrise at <span>Berghain</span>, nightlife here is not just entertainment — it’s a cultural phenomenon.
